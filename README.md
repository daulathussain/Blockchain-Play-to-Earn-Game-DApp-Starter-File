## Project Overview

Create & Deploy Blockchain Play-to-Earn Game DApp | Earn ERC20 Tokens Using Solidity & Next.js (Any Blockchain)

In this full step-by-step tutorial, you will learn how to create and deploy a Blockchain Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game DApp where users can earn ERC20 tokens by playing the game.

We will build everything from scratch using:

✅ Solidity Smart Contracts
✅ ERC20 Token Creation
✅ Next.js Frontend
✅ Web3 Wallet Connection (MetaMask)
✅ Deploy on any EVM-compatible blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
✅ Smart Contract Integration with Frontend

By the end of this video, you will have your own fully functional Play-to-Earn Web3 Game DApp that rewards users with ERC20 tokens.

This tutorial is perfect for:

- Blockchain Developers
- Web3 Developers
- Solidity Beginners to Advanced
- Anyone building GameFi projects
- Developers who want to monetize games using crypto
